Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address? - The client Artemis Financial 
is a financial institution serving an array of financial and investment services. The issues addressed the account holders, who's data and financial security rests on Artemis. 
This includes overseas transactions, banking, investment accounts and professionally managed portfolios. Artemis's clients include government, corporations, and individuals.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing? - I think my dependency 
checks were great, and I was even able to find exactly what file(s) in the dependency was the issue. As I have mentioned
before nobody wants to become the next Equifax. Financial data is akin to health data. Not something anyone wants exposed. I think not only do security breaches destroy the 
lives of the individuals affected they destroy the reputation of the company. 

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you? - I struggled the most with the building out the certificates. I believe this was due to some environmental issues from my machine. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use? - I think a lot of this stems from architecture. I think when thinking of 
security it needs to be at the forefront of the building process not an afterthought. Also I think dependency checks and updates need to be built into the pipeline, there needs to be positions on the team like Security 
DevOps doing these tasks. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? - Dependency checks and unit testing.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks? - Well maven dependency checks are amazing, I will be seeing if I can incorporate this tool into the work I am 
currently doing. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment? - While any future employer can not
see all of my assignments, nor can they see my email chains between the professor, other students and myself. They should know that my experience has been do not give up. I failed at assignments, over and over and over 
again. I persistently tried something new. I went back over steps to the assignment and cross referenced errors I was getting on Google, Stack Overflow and forums. While I may not be immediately "gifted" at this, I kept 
trying until I got a solution. The puzzle solving aspect of the work brought me joy. If I knew the answer immediately I probably wouldn't enjoy the puzzle. Sure I had moments of frustration, moments of panic on whether or 
not I could complete the work. But persistence was key and I found myself rewarded.
